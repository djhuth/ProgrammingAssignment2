## Assignment 2, week 3, R-programming: 
##
## 1. function makeCacheMatrix creates a matrix object
## 2. function cacheSolve retrieves inverse of the matrix
##    returned by makeCacheMatrix from cache if it exists
##    or else computes the inverse and stores it in cache


## creates a matrix object that can cache its inverse
## cf. sample function makeVector
## uses "superassignment"-operator <<- 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## creates and returns the inverse of above matrix
## if doesn't already exist in cache
## if it does exist in cache (and is unchanged), it 
## retrieves it from cach
## cf. sample function cachemean

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
